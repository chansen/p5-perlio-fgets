NAME
    PerlIO::fgets - Provides a "fgets()" like function for PerlIO file
    handles

SYNOPSIS
        $octets = fgets(STDIN, 1024);
        $octets = fgets(*STDIN, 1024);
        $octets = fgets(\*STDIN, 1024);
    
        while ( ! eof($fh) ) {
            defined( $_ = fgets($fh, 1024) ) or die "fgets failed: $!";
            ...
        }

DESCRIPTION
    Provides a "fgets()" like function for PerlIO file handles

FUNCTIONS
  fgets
    Attempts to read a line from the given file handle $fh.

    *Usage*

        $octets = fgets($fh, $maximum);

    *Arguments*

    $fh The file handle to read from. Must be a PerlIO file handle.

    $maximum
        A positive integer containing the maximum number of octets to be
        read from the file handle (including the trailing newline
        character).

    *Returns*

    If "fgets" encounters end-of-file before a newline or $maximum octets
    read before a newline, it returns the octets. If "fgets" reaches
    end-of-file before reading any octets, it returns an empty string. If
    unsuccessful, "fgets" returns "undef" and $! contains the I/O error.

    *Note*

    Unlike stdio's "fgets()", this implementation is not sensitive to input
    containing null characters.

EXPORTS
    "fgets"

LIMITATIONS
    Current implementation has no understanding of Unicode (UTF-X), only
    octets.
